- Click a button and a feedback (e.g., loading an image) is one change
- Swipe right and show the menu is one change
- Not the 5 buttons that simply changes the display
* (possibly) Utilize your assignment!
* You can mock a complex user interaction: 
- file upload - load a new canvas with file browser design
- camera input – place a gray placeholder for taking photo, load a prestored picture once taking picture action is done
- access to the photo library – create a canvas with gird images
